# Supervised Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the implementation and reproduction of a [study](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Unfair-Reviews-Detection-on-Amazon-Reviews-using-Elmurngi-Gherbi/111300a2917d62036b16d49f2e401eb10eb2b572#citing-papers) on detecting unfair reviews in Amazon reviews using sentiment analysis and supervised learning techniques. The project serves as a learning exercise in machine learning and natural language processing, focusing on concepts such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.

## Overview

In online shopping, customer reviews play a crucial role in shaping buying decisions. However, unfair reviews—whether overly positive, neutral, or negative—can mislead customers and disrupt market fairness. This project explores how sentiment analysis can be applied to detect and classify such unfair reviews using machine learning techniques.

## Key Features

- Text preprocessing using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer.
- Application of supervised learning algorithms, including:
    - Naive Bayes
    - Decision Tree
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Logistic Regression
- Classification of reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of Amazon customer reviews. Preprocessed data includes text fields such as review content and sentiment labels.
